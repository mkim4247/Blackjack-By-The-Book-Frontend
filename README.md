# README
Blackjack By the Book was created to help teach basic blackjack strategy and let players just play blackjack for fun. Players can create an account to keep track of their performance or sign in as a guest. All standard actions are available for the player, such as Hitting, Staying, Doubling, Splitting, and Surrendering, as appropriate. The game is played with six decks of cards, the dealer must draw to 17, and the dealer hits on soft 17.

The frontend was developed on React 16.7.0 and Redux 4.0.1, and also utilizes React-DOM, React-Router-DOM, and Redux-Thunk. Fetch requests are made to the "Deck of Cards API," which is a third party API that returns the card objects that are used in this game. These fetches occur upon login to set the deck and for player actions involving the cards.
